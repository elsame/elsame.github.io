<div class="blurb">
	My name is Elsa Margrét Einarsdóttir.
	<br>I´m programmer with 10 years of experience.
	<br>My main programming languages are C#, C++ and Python.
	<br>I Have B.S. and M.S. degree in Computer science from the University of Iceland.
	<br>Here you can read my <a href="/blog">blog</a> where I'm trying to help people to start trying out new things 
  <br>and hopefully with time there will be more complicated things I have been doing.
	<br>Maybe there is something there that helps you.
	<P>
