# How to create a simple Rest Service and use Entity Model to connect to local database #

In my this blog I´m gonna write simple tutorial to get people start trying new things. My first blog is about how to use 
Vistual Studio 2017 to create a Rest Service Api. Hopefully a help for someone new.

## Step 1 ##

Open Visual Studio 2017. Select File->New->Project. Under Web section select ASP.NET Web Application (.Net framework) and name it RestfulService or whatever you want.
