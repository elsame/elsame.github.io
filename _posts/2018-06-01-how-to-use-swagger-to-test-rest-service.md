In last blog we created Rest API Service but now we are going to test it. The most popular way now days is to use Swagger so we are going to do that in this blog. Here is a link to my previous project: https://github.com/elsame/RestfulService

We are going to implement Swagger using SwashBuckle. Open the project tahta we created in our last blog. Right click on the project and select Manage NuGet packages and in the browse search window we look for SwashBuckle and install it.
