I´m showing how easy it is to create Web client using Rest service in Visual Studio 2017.
So here you can find the finish project of the Web Client : <https://github.com/elsame/WebClientForRestService> and it uses the Rest Service I created in my earlier blog: <https://github.com/elsame/RestfulService>

This blog is based on the article <https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/consuming-asp-net-web-api-rest-service-in-asp-net-mvc-using-http-client/>

So you can also fallow that article. The only thing here that is different is that I add the code for all the view, not just the employee list and I´m using my Rest service that uses Entity Framework and Local Database.
